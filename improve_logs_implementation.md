# Implementation Guide for Improved Logging

This guide explains how to integrate the improved logging formatter into the medical assistant chatbot.

## Integration Steps

1. **Copy the improved logger code**:
   - Add the `ImprovedConsoleFormatter` class and `setup_improved_logging()` function from `improve_logging.py` to your project.
   - Recommended location: Create a new module at `src/utils/logging_utils.py`

2. **Initialize the improved logging at application startup**:
   - In your main application file (likely `app.py` or `main.py`), add:
   ```python
   from src.utils.logging_utils import setup_improved_logging
   
   # Setup improved logging at the very beginning
   setup_improved_logging()
   ```

3. **Improve existing log messages**:
   - Update key log messages to include clearer transition markers
   - Examples:
     ```python
     # Start of symptom analysis
     logger.info("Starting symptom analysis for message: '%s'", user_message)
     
     # Start of doctor search
     logger.info("Starting doctor search with query: '%s'", search_query)
     
     # Database operations
     logger.info("Executing SQL query...")
     ```

## Example Log Output

With the improved logger, a typical interaction will produce logs like:

```
15:56:09.944 INFO     [agent       ] SYMPTOM DETECTION: Checking message for symptoms: 'i am feeling toothace...'

========== STARTING SYMPTOM ANALYSIS [15:56:10.144] ==========

========== STARTING DOCTOR SEARCH [15:56:26.877] ==========
15:56:26.877 INFO     [agent_tools ] Starting dynamic doctor search with message: Find Dentistry specialist in Endodontics in Riyadh
15:56:26.878 INFO     [query_builder] Starting doctor search with query: 'Find Dentistry specialist in Endodontics in Riyadh'

--- QUERY BUILDER [15:56:27.275] ---
15:56:27.276 INFO     [query_builder] Extracted criteria: {'speciality': 'Dentistry', 'subspeciality': 'Endodontics', 'location': 'Riyadh'}

--- DATABASE QUERY [15:56:28.065] ---

15:56:28.199 INFO     [agent       ] No doctors found matching the criteria
```

## Benefits

- Clear section headers make it easy to follow the execution flow
- Reduced duplicated information (SQL query logged only once)
- Visual distinction between different components (symptom analysis, query building, database)
- Timestamp on each log line for performance analysis
- Colored output for better readability in terminal

IMPORTANT: Analyze the conversation history carefully to match the EXACT language style, tone, and writing pattern of the user and the main assistant.
Pay special attention to:
1. The language being used (English, Arabic, Urdu, etc.)
2. The writing style (formal/informal, technical/casual)
3. The tone of the conversation
4. Any specific patterns or phrases used
5. The level of formality
